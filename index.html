  <p id="blah-blah">The 3 photos above are examples of mosaic, kirigami and watercolour painting. I wish I could say they were created from my own hands - I am still learning, practicing and experimenting - Rome was not built in a day!</p>      
  
                
  <h2>My Experiences From The Different Mediums:</h2>
        <ul class="fun-list">
          <li><strong>Drawing:</strong> My first drawing was for an open call to submit artwork on the theme of 'Light and Dark' for a gallery cafe exhibition. My picture was chosen and was hooked after that to develop and continue drawing. My style is drawing with coloured pencils on black paper.</li>
          <li><strong>Watercolour Painting:</strong> I tried this for the first time at a 'Paint A Summer Meadow' workshop. It was one of the most relaxing and free-flowing experience, without worrying if I was doing it wrong because watercolouring is very forgiving!</li>
          <li><strong>Kirigami:</strong> This is a step-up from origami - origami is folding paper; kirigami is cutting and shaping. Cutting is the easiest part; shaping it afterwards is fiddly! Amazed though what you can create from a sheet of paper.</li>
          <li><strong>Textiles:</strong> Not only did I learn about textiles but also how to reuse/recycle: making a bag by weaving an assortment of different coloured shoelaces (!) and making a stud purse/card holder from the front end of a tie (!!)</li>
          <li><strong>Ceramics:</strong> This was my most experimental medium and one that involved the longest process: from rolling and shaping the clay to be baked, to then be glazed (clay-painted) before being baked again!</li>
          <li><strong>Mosaics:</strong> My least favourite as am not very artistic when it comes to making a design/picture from little bits of tiles, especially if they are different and random shapes and sizes!</li>
          <li><strong>Coding:</strong> This is my latest venture and currently on the Introduction to Digital course as a complete beginner. This webpage is my Step 4 assignment! Better crack on - still have 3 more steps to complete before 28th September! </li>
